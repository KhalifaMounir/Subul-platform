You’ve designed for multi-region, high-availability environments.
You’ve played with service mesh tools like Istio.
AWS certifications? Cool, but not required.

Software Engineer,Allium,1 month ago,Remote,https://himalayas.app/companies/allium/jobs/software-engineer-5065535296,"Allium makes blockchain data accurate, simple and fast
Blockchain data is hard, messy, and chaotic
When we started out in late 2021 our thesis was simple - blockchain data, despite it being public and free, was difficult to understand, clunky to access and troublesome to maintain. Answering a simple question like “Who are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?” requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.
Accessing data is hard because blockchains are optimized for Writes and not Reads
Why is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.
Parsing and interpreting blockchain data requires both deep domain expertise and data manipulation
To quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, “Blockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.” They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.
Allium abstracts the complexity with a simple way to query blockchain data
Allium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data. As of this post, the data we’ve archived across 40+ blockchains is in the petabytes and growing exponentially.
Google and Bloomberg had to organize the world's public financial and webpage data, Allium is on a mission to do the same for blockchain data
This is one of the rare times in history where indexing a giant public dataset is sorely needed by all - similar to what Bloomberg did for financial data and what Google organized for public webpage data. With this indexed data, we are fortunate to support trailblazers in this industry and play some role the industry’s most exciting trends:
About our customers
We serve 2 groups of customers today with the same data but different platform. Analysts who need to answer data questions about the blockchain (think BI) and Engineers who need highly reliable data queryable in near realtime (think Application backends). Our customers include the biggest institutions Visa, Stripe, Grayscale and also the biggest crypto companies such as Phantom, Uniswap. Allium is one of the unique companies in the industry that bridge blockchain and non blockchain worlds.
About the Role
We love engineers who love solving new problems every single day.
Data Egress - How does one transport 100s of TBs of data around the world without breaking the piggybank? (https://www.databricks.com/blog/announcing-public-preview-delta-sharing-cloudflare-r2-integration)
Handle high traffic - How can we support the biggest applications in this industry and allow handle 100,000 QPS at peak traffic and not go down? (https://www.allium.so/post/the-inside-story-of-the-jup-airdrop-at-phantom)
Botnets - This industry is in its early days, how does one catch botnets based on their behavioral patterns? (https://www.allium.so/post/initial-report-for-the-10-6k-botnet)
Fraud (Sybil) Detection - Is it possible to transfer the same fraud detection heuristics into this blockchain world? (https://www.allium.so/post/from-eligibility-to-sybil-detection-a-deep-dive-into-wormholes-multichain-airdrop)
Who is real? - What constitutes meaningful and organic transactions on the blockchain? (https://www.allium.so/post/visa-x-allium-making-sense-of-stablecoins)
Bring Your Own Transformation - How do we let our customers design their own APIs and transform their own realtime data streams? (https://docs.allium.so/allium-app/explorer-api/quickstart)
Data Governance - We pride ourselves on our data quality - How can we ensure our data is consistent across every copy and every region 24/7?
AI and LLMs - How does one design the LLM and AI experience on top of our data to lower the barrier of entry to crypto data? (https://docs.allium.so/allium-app/allium-explorer/allium-ai-assistant)
Data Transformation Holy grail:How can one unify streaming and batch transformation logic into a single code base?
If any of those bore you, we have many many more problems we have to solve!
Allium sizzle reel
Giant infrastructure budget per head
You will make mistakes, costly mistakes, but at Allium's expense. We have an internal leaderboard of the costliest infrastructure mistakes made, and we (try to) learn from them. We don't have fancy Michelin-starred meal budgets, but we have a huge infrastructure budget for one to get better at your craft. Why? We leverage every tool (no prereqs) out there because we meet our enterprise customers where they are at:
Every OLAP: Snowflake, Databricks, Bigquery, Clickhouse*
Every OLTP: Postgres, Aurora
Every Event bus: Kafka, SNS, PubSub
Every Cloud Provider: AWS, GCP, Azure (one day)
A copy of data in every region: US East, Central, West, Europe, Asia
Every data transformation and orchestration tool: Apache Beam, Materialize, TinyBird, DBT, SQLMesh, Temporal
Data governance tools: DataFold
(if any of the names above sound like foreign Pokemon names, fret not, you can come here and catch them all, we are here to teach and make you successful.)
Don't take our word for it, what our customers say about us (https://www.allium.so/blog#love)
What some ~cool people have to say about us:
Mario Gabriele from The Generalist's Future 50 Startup List: https://www.allium.so/post/allium-named-awardee-of-the-generalists-inaugural-future-50-startups
Tomasz Tungus from Theory Ventures:https://tomtunguz.com/allium/
Bucky Moore from Kleiner Perkins: https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/allium-series-a/
Ok.. now for some tough love, here are the values we strive for at Allium:
Pro Athlete Mindset - Consistency. Day in and day out, in pursuit of excellence. A win yesterday does not guarantee (or even imply!) a win tomorrow. I hope anyone who supports a failing sports team will feel the pain (cough Man United fans) of inconsistency
Figure It Out & Extreme Ownership - Every day is unexplored territory. There are new engineering frameworks, new legal docs, new compliance, new sales, new regulations, and new operational procedures every single day. If you don’t know it, learn it. If you can’t learn it, find someone or a product that does it. If you can’t find someone, find someone who can find someone. It is never lack of resources, but lack of resourcefulness.
High Agency - (One of) the highest commonality between all successful people is their responsiveness, most successful billionaire CEOs still reply to emails within minutes (within working hours). And when you reply, respond fast with effective solutions - and even better, resolutions. If you’re looking for a superpower, you can’t go wrong with responsiveness. Well of course this doesn't make sense when you're an engineer coding in flow, but in general high agency of problem solving gets one very far in life
Leading from the Front - No one is going to listen (and adopt) your suggestion unless you lead by example. It’s one thing to say We need to do XYZ this better & it’s another thing to build an MVP and say “This is the way we should do things”. The proof of work and momentum goes a long way.
Strong Opinions On the Future (loosely held) It is okay to be wrong, but what is not okay is not to have an idea of how a better future should be. Alliumites take pride in trying to improving everything about the company all the time.
Sense of (allium) business smell - There are number of folks who live to eat at Allium, but the Allium smell we are talking about is that we love folks who naturally want to know why and how the work they are doing builds leverage for their teammates and also relates to the business goals
About the team
We invite people of all backgrounds (https://www.allium.so/about). We have engineers who learnt coding much later in life, who learnt coding on the side, we have engineers who are still in school and we also have engineers who went to the top schools (CMU, Stanford, UIUC, UPenn, Oxford, NUS, Cornell), all are welcome if one comes in with a curious mind and an infectious work ethic.
Administrative Benefits
Medical, Dental, Vision, Life and AD&D insurance - US folks get 100% coverage for Gold plans, 80% for dependents
Note: The sun never sets on Allium - we hire from any geographical location as long as you are willing to overlap 2 hours overlap on NYC mornings Mon-Thurs from 10am-12pm ET. We have people based in New York, Seattle, Singapore and Australia
All applicants have to answer this pop quiz: ""What is an Allium? What is your favorite Allium?"". Bonus points for the right pronunciation."

Enabling innovation by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.
Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like a16z, Sequoia, and Redpoint, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.

Halcyon is the industry’s first dedicated, adaptive security platform that combines multiple proprietary advanced prevention engines along with AI models focused specifically on stopping ransomware.
Who we are:
Halcyon was formed in 2021 by a team of cyber industry veterans after battling the scourge of ransomware (and advanced threats) for years at some of the largest global security vendors. Comprised of leaders from Cylance (now Blackberry), Accuvant (now Optiv), Fireye and ISS X-Force (now IBM), Halcyon is focused on building products and solutions for mid-market and enterprise customers.
As a remote-native, completely distributed global team, we recognize great talent can exist anywhere. We invite you to apply to a job you’re interested in and we'll work a plan to meet your needs.
The Role:
As our Lead Cloud DevOps Engineer, you’ll take technical ownership of our cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices. This role blends deep hands-on engineering with functional leadership. You’ll design resilient systems, scale infrastructure, mentor engineers, and collaborate across product, platform, and security teams.
This is a senior individual contributor role—not a management position—ideal for someone who wants to shape technical direction, lead by example, and remain deeply technical.
Responsibilities:
Set technical direction for infrastructure, CI/CD, observability, and automation within the DevOps function.
Architect and maintain scalable, secure infrastructure on AWS using Terraform, Kubernetes, and related tooling.
Own and improve CI/CD workflows, enabling fast and reliable deployments across teams.
Mentor and support DevOps engineers, fostering autonomy, quality, and professional growth.
Define and track operational metrics, including deployment success rate, infrastructure cost, scaling efficiency, and recovery time.
Drive incident readiness and response, ensuring strong observability and alerting across systems.
Collaborate cross-functionally to align infrastructure goals with broader product and platform objectives.
Skills and Qualifications:
8+ years of experience in cloud infrastructure and DevOps engineering, with 2+ years leading technically (as a tech lead, principal, or architect).
Deep experience with AWS and infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform preferred).
Proficient with Kubernetes and deployment tooling such as Helm.
You know CI/CD inside and out—GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Jenkins, whatever gets the job done.
You can script in Python, Bash, or something similar.
Familiarity with observability tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, Datadog, or ELK/OpenSearch.
Strong understanding of cloud security practices: IAM, encryption, secure network design, compliance.
Proven ability to mentor, lead technical initiatives, and drive strategic outcomes.
Solid understanding of systems performance and reliability, with experience improving deployment reliability and infrastructure scalability.
Comfortable working in a polyglot environment (e.g., Scala, C#, Python).
You’ve got strong opinions on infrastructure—and the humility to evolve them.
You care about security, performance, and doing things the right way.
You’re collaborative, curious, and not afraid to get in the weeds.
Bonus Skills and Qualifications:
You’ve worked with Kafka, Postgres, DynamoDB, or OpenSearch.
You’ve designed for multi-region, high-availability environments.
You’ve played with service mesh tools like Istio.
AWS certifications? Cool, but not required.
Benefits:
Halcyon offers the following benefits to eligible employees:
Comprehensive healthcare (medical, dental, and vision) with premiums paid in full for employees and dependents.
401k plan with a generous employer contribution.
Short and long-term disability coverage, basic life and ADD insurance plans.
Medical and dependent care FSA options.
Flexible PTO policy.
Parental leave.
Generous equity offering.
The Company reserves the right to modify or change these benefits programs at any time, with or without notice.
Base Salary Range: $190,000 - $220,000
Bonus Target: 10%
In accordance with applicable state and federal laws, the range provided is Halcyon’s reasonable estimate of the base compensation for this role. The actual amount may differ based on non-discriminatory factors such as experience, knowledge, skills, abilities, and location. Base pay is one part of the total package that is provided to compensate and recognize employees for their work, and this role may be eligible for additional discretionary bonuses/incentives, and equity in the Company.
We understand it takes a diverse team of highly intelligent, passionate, curious, and creative people to develop the exceptional product we are building. Our dynamic team has incredible perspectives to share, just as we know you do, and we take great pride in being an equal opportunity employer."

Senior Account Executive,Canonical,23 days ago,Remote,https://himalayas.app/companies/canonical/jobs/senior-account-executive,"Open source software is the new default in the enterprise, and Canonical is the new challenger to major enterprise software vendors.
We deliver better open source from the data center to cloud and edge. Our Linux distribution Ubuntu is now the leading platform for public cloud compute, and the favorite platform for software engineers, data scientists and AI developers. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption and quality of open source globally, and our goal is to ship the most software on the planet by cores. A tidal wave of open source innovation is the next phase of the entire enterprise software industry, and we aim to be the most compelling way to ride that wave.
Our customers include Global 500 enterprises and startups. We are expanding our product range from the base operating system - Ubuntu - to full enterprise solutions in infrastructure and applications. We can deliver software defined storage, private cloud solutions, container runtime environments, as well as databases, message queues, identity, observability, analytics, machine learning and web publishing capabilities. Customers love the idea that they can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application.
Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are just over 1,000 colleagues in 70+ countries and $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.
We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.
In building our sales team, we look for five things:
Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems
High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence
Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes
Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions
Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers
Ubuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.
The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their assigned territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagement, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness, to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container technologies and technical software solutions to senior levels of the enterprise.
Location: We are expanding our sales organisation globally and have open roles in every region.
What your day will look like
Represent the company, its solutions and software, in your territory
Build and execute a territory plan to prioritize outreach and prospecting
Develop new pipeline through outreach, prospecting, local marketing, and industry events
Close contracts to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targets
Be mindful and proactive in achieving tactical and strategic objectives
Manage customer relationships and interactions through all stages of the sales cycle
Work with field engineers to propose solutions that solve our customers’ business problems

Maintain accurate pipeline data and forecasts within Salesforce
Establish productive professional relationships with key influencers and decision makers
What we are looking for in you
Bachelor's level degree, preferably in engineering or computer science
Experience of open source technology and solutions
Detail oriented with effective follow-up
Experience in enterprise software or technology sales planning and execution
Track record of achievement in sales targets and new account wins
Self-discipline and motivation to be successful in a distributed team
Professional written and spoken English, as well as any language that may be appropriate for your target market
Ability to travel for customer engagements, industry events and company events
Additional skills of interest
Specific vertical experience, in particular finance, telco, health, energy, public sector, tech
Experience speaking at conferences or industry events
What we offer you
We consider geographical location, experience, and performance when shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven commission structure. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.

We recruit on a global basis and set a very high standard for people joining the company. We expect excellence - in order to succeed, we need to be the best at what we do.

Our mission is to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. When everyone can contribute, consumers become contributors, significantly accelerating the rate of human progress. This mission is integral to our culture, influencing how we hire, build products, and lead our industry. We make this possible at GitLab by running our operations on our product and staying aligned with our values. Learn more about Life at GitLab.
Thanks to products like Duo Enterprise, and Duo Workflow, customers get the benefit of AI at every stage of the SDLC. The same principles built into our products are reflected in how our team works: we embrace AI as a core productivity multiplier. All team members are encouraged and expected to incorporate AI into their daily workflows to drive efficiency, innovation, and impact across our global organisation.
An overview of this role
Support Engineering at GitLab isn’t just a title - you will be embedded within the Engineering department and will truly operate in an environment where Support and Engineering meet. You’ll interact with customers daily as they encounter the difficult edge cases of running GitLab in complex environments. In the space of a day, you might be doing behind the scenes work of a Linux administrator troubleshooting performance problems by using strace on a particular process, interacting with the Product team to ensure that steps in a bug report are reproducible, or interacting with the Engineering team itself by diving deep into our codebase and putting together a merge request to actually fix a customer issue.
That’s not all though - you’d equally be invited to contribute to the source code, improve our documentation, and help build out more efficient support processes in our issue tracker. We want to live in a world where everyone can contribute, and as a member of the support team, there are no barriers to using your skills to improve the experience of our users and customers.
Some examples of our projects:
A tool to quickly analyze strace output
A solution to capture the state of a customer’s server for easier troubleshooting
A tool which turns log files into interactive tables to easily sort and filter columns
A functionality to ChatOps to make it easier to identify user accounts on GitLab.com
What you’ll do
Support a mix of Self-managed and GitLab.com (SaaS) customers and resolve their issues via Zendesk tickets, merge requests, email and video conferencing
Collaborate with our Product, Development, Infrastructure, Customer Success and Sales Teams to build new features and fix bugs, define and shape the product goals, roadmap, priorities, and strategy
Create and update documentation based on customer interactions
Collaborate with Support team members (through Pairing Sessions) and other GitLab team members (for example: as a Support Stable Counterpart)
Participate in regular rotations for weekday and weekend on-call coverage (daytime only), providing emergency support to our Self-managed and SaaS customers, or working with our SaaS Production team to coordinate incident communications
Participate in our hiring processes by reviewing applications and assessments, and by participating in interviews.
What you’ll bring
Experience in, and passion for managing customer facing cases throughout the entire support lifecycle from initial customer inquiry to triage and reproduction, writing bug reports for hand off to the development team, and case resolution
Excellent Linux systems administration knowledge (LFCE or RHCE equivalent knowledge)
Ability to use scripting languages (preferably Ruby or Bash), and MVC frameworks (preferably Ruby on Rails)
Experience with Git and CI/CD
Expertise in writing support content
Ability to communicate complex technical topics to customers and coworkers of varying technical skill level
Familiarity with DevOps methodologies and technologies like Serverless and Kubernetes
Understand a range of different GitLab implementations, and how service interruptions impact the customer.
About the team
The Support team is distributed all over the world across AMER, EMEA, and APAC regions. Support Engineers work on Support Tickets and helping GitLab’s customers, but they also dig into the code and logs to find out why something is not working as expected. The Collaboration here at GitLab is extraordinary and exciting - Support Engineers solve complex problems together and participate in regular pairing sessions and 1:1s, as well as coffee chats and Slack conversations that help them stay connected. Team members are given the ability to structure their shift the way it best suits their private life while maintaining our ability to address customer issues.

Experienced Ruby Product Engineer,Silverfin,17 days ago,Remote,https://himalayas.app/companies/silverfin/jobs/experienced-ruby-product-engineer,"We start with the cliff notes about the position. If this appeals to you, continue reading for a longer text about working at Silverfin and your role 👇
At Silverfin, we're an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. Although we know we’re not perfect yet, we are working hard on it and always open for your feedback.
According to our vision to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive organisation, our policy is to only make a final hiring decision if underrepresented groups are sufficiently represented in the list of candidates applying for the position. For this reason it’s possible interviews get slightly delayed until we’ve reached that goal.
We're committed to elevating talent by creating an environment where we can all thrive together. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily check every single box, please consider applying. We'd love to hear how you might contribute to our mission and our team.
What can we offer you?
Actual, proper work-life balance
A salary range of €104.000 - €130.000 a year
Flexible working hours and work 100% remotely
Personal growth training and opportunities
Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 40+ colleagues in 14 different countries on two continents
A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues
A €1200 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills
Two engineering retreats per year, somewhere in Europe
Ten company-wide Wellbeing Days per year for all employees (once a month, except in July and August)

What will you work on?
Figure out the best way to solve a customer or business problem in close collaboration with a product manager, a product designer and other engineers
Work on user facing functionalities
Help with discovery and delivery of a solution
Give the engineering perspective on potential ways of approaching a specific challenge
Help with maintenance and support of existing functionality
What are we looking for?
You’re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels if necessary.
You have experience using Javascript framework(s), understand the value of them, but also know when plain Javascript is enough.
You're interested in getting to know our customers to find the best solution for a given challenge.
You can communicate clearly in English, both in writing and verbally.
You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognise bike-shedding and can avoid its pitfalls.
You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design.
You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.
You’ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary.
If you’re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on engineering-jobs@silverfin.com, or read on for the more detailed explanation ..
What’s a Silverfin?At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.
The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every week more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.
Since November 2023 we are proudly part of Visma - the European leader in mission-critical cloud software, enjoying the power of the Visma brand and resources whilst retaining business autonomy and go-to-market freedom.
What’s the product team like?The product team is a cross-functional team where engineers work together closely with product managers and product designers. The team's input is a user or business problem which it can solve with a high degree of autonomy. From day one all profiles are involved in understanding the problem, ideating solutions and doing quick experiments to prove that a certain solution might actually lead to the desired outcome. After the discovery phase the same team is tasked with the delivery of the chosen solution. The team will then track the adoption of the solution and will make sure that the problem is actually solved. The setup of the team is largely based on the book ""Inspired"" by Marty Cagan.
What does working at Silverfin look like?Next to the three product teams, there are four more platformy teams, who own complex subsystems, like syncs or AI, and or support the product teams with knowledge, frameworks and services.
Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”.
We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Google Meet as our remote conferencing tool of choice.
No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.
Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.
*: Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?
What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?We’re a remote-first engineering team of 40 people distributed in 14 different countries over two continents. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.
Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids - whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself.
You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.
Being remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in Quip, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!
We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.
What does your future look like?Personal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don’t need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager.
Everyone has a €1200 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day.

We build developer tools for authentication. We're known for our React components like and that ""just work"" when they're added to the page.
Our components are powered by a new type of API: a frontend-facing API that relies on session tokens for authorization, instead of a backend-facing API that relies on a secret key. We've found this pattern unlocks a new level of efficiency. Developers can implement Clerk faster than traditional APIs because it comes built-in with UX and UI.
To learn more about the approach, see our talk on A Component is Worth a Thousand APIs.

Provide expert technical support to fellow developers, ranging from quick implementation guidance to complex architectural consultations
Collaborate on product development, including our core platform and upcoming support product offerings

Contribute to technical documentation and guides based on real-world developer needs
Investigate and document product bugs, working closely with the engineering team on solutions
Balance engineering and support responsibilities based on your interests and our team's needs
Directly influence product development through your constant interactions with the developers and customers using the product
Work with a tight-knit team that values playfulness, collaboration, and shared ownership
Build products and tools that directly impact developer productivity and satisfaction, and that make your own job better/easier
What We're Looking For
Expertise in JavaScript/TypeScript development
Extensive experience with React and Next.js
Practical experience working with PostgreSQL or similar relational databases
Some amount of familiarity working with cloud infrastructure (GCP experience is a plus)
Comfort working with browsers, REST APIs, and web technologies
Outstanding written and verbal communication abilities
Demonstrated experience helping other developers succeed, whether through mentorship, support, or documentation
Ability to quickly understand and debug complex technical issues
Empathy for customers and a drive for excellence in developer experience
Self-motivated with a proven ability to take ownership of projects and see them through
Nice-to-Haves
Experience using Clerk in production applications
Knowledge of Go programming language (Clerk’s backend code is written in Go)
Experience with Cloudflare products
Background in developer tools or developer-facing products
Track record of contributing to technical documentation
Experience with auth/user management systems
History of participating in developer communities
Who You'll Work With

High polish and attention to detail in everything we deliver
Open communication and knowledge sharing
Continuous learning and improvement
Benefits:

Halcyon is the industry’s first dedicated, adaptive security platform that combines multiple proprietary advanced prevention engines along with AI models focused specifically on stopping ransomware.
Who we are:
Halcyon was formed in 2021 by a team of cyber industry veterans after battling the scourge of ransomware (and advanced threats) for years at some of the largest global security vendors. Comprised of leaders from Cylance (now Blackberry), Accuvant (now Optiv), Fireye and ISS X-Force (now IBM), Halcyon is focused on building products and solutions for mid-market and enterprise customers.
As a remote-native, completely distributed global team, we recognize great talent can exist anywhere. We invite you to apply to a job you’re interested in and we'll work a plan to meet your needs.
The Role:
As our Lead Cloud DevOps Engineer, you’ll take technical ownership of our cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices. This role blends deep hands-on engineering with functional leadership. You’ll design resilient systems, scale infrastructure, mentor engineers, and collaborate across product, platform, and security teams.
This is a senior individual contributor role—not a management position—ideal for someone who wants to shape technical direction, lead by example, and remain deeply technical.
Responsibilities:
Set technical direction for infrastructure, CI/CD, observability, and automation within the DevOps function.
Architect and maintain scalable, secure infrastructure on AWS using Terraform, Kubernetes, and related tooling.
Own and improve CI/CD workflows, enabling fast and reliable deployments across teams.
Mentor and support DevOps engineers, fostering autonomy, quality, and professional growth.
Define and track operational metrics, including deployment success rate, infrastructure cost, scaling efficiency, and recovery time.
Drive incident readiness and response, ensuring strong observability and alerting across systems.
Collaborate cross-functionally to align infrastructure goals with broader product and platform objectives.
Skills and Qualifications:
8+ years of experience in cloud infrastructure and DevOps engineering, with 2+ years leading technically (as a tech lead, principal, or architect).
Deep experience with AWS and infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform preferred).
Proficient with Kubernetes and deployment tooling such as Helm.
You know CI/CD inside and out—GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Jenkins, whatever gets the job done.
You can script in Python, Bash, or something similar.
Familiarity with observability tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, Datadog, or ELK/OpenSearch.
Strong understanding of cloud security practices: IAM, encryption, secure network design, compliance.
Proven ability to mentor, lead technical initiatives, and drive strategic outcomes.
Solid understanding of systems performance and reliability, with experience improving deployment reliability and infrastructure scalability.
Comfortable working in a polyglot environment (e.g., Scala, C#, Python).
You’ve got strong opinions on infrastructure—and the humility to evolve them.
You care about security, performance, and doing things the right way.
You’re collaborative, curious, and not afraid to get in the weeds.
Bonus Skills and Qualifications:
You’ve worked with Kafka, Postgres, DynamoDB, or OpenSearch.
You’ve designed for multi-region, high-availability environments.
You’ve played with service mesh tools like Istio.
AWS certifications? Cool, but not required.
Benefits:
Halcyon offers the following benefits to eligible employees:
Comprehensive healthcare (medical, dental, and vision) with premiums paid in full for employees and dependents.
401k plan with a generous employer contribution.
Short and long-term disability coverage, basic life and ADD insurance plans.
Medical and dependent care FSA options.
Flexible PTO policy.
Parental leave.
Generous equity offering.
The Company reserves the right to modify or change these benefits programs at any time, with or without notice.
Base Salary Range: $190,000 - $220,000
Bonus Target: 10%
In accordance with applicable state and federal laws, the range provided is Halcyon’s reasonable estimate of the base compensation for this role. The actual amount may differ based on non-discriminatory factors such as experience, knowledge, skills, abilities, and location. Base pay is one part of the total package that is provided to compensate and recognize employees for their work, and this role may be eligible for additional discretionary bonuses/incentives, and equity in the Company.
We understand it takes a diverse team of highly intelligent, passionate, curious, and creative people to develop the exceptional product we are building. Our dynamic team has incredible perspectives to share, just as we know you do, and we take great pride in being an equal opportunity employer."

We have raised $77M and are backed by Craft Ventures (previously invested in Tesla, Facebook, Airbnb ), Nexus Venture Partners (previously invested in Postman, Apollo.io,MinIO, Druva) and Uncorrelated Ventures (previously invested in Redis, Rollbar & Gradle).
We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates' personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers.

We are seeking a Senior IT Engineer to take ownership of our internal systems and infrastructure, drive automation, and lead the implementation of modern IT standards across the organization. This role is perfect for someone excited to scale secure, low-friction IT experiences in a fast-paced, remote-first environment.

What You'll Do
Access & Automation: Replace manual access requests with scalable, automated workflows. Implement SSO solutions and integrate provisioning into Rippling. Build IT ticketing systems and self-service portals to streamline support.

Proven experience implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions from start to finish.
Strong working knowledge of Google Workspace administration, SaaS management, and cloud-first infrastructure.

Excellent communication and documentation skills.
Nice to Have
Experience with SOC 2, ISO 27001, or similar compliance standards.
Familiarity with zero trust architecture and principles.
Background in supporting distributed, remote-first teams across multiple time zones.

In order to be compliant with local legislation, as well as to provide greater transparency to candidates, we share salary ranges on all job postings regardless of desired hiring location. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including geographic location as well as candidate experience and expertise, and may vary from the amounts listed above.
We have noticed a rise in recruiting impersonations across the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates' personal and financial information through fake interviews and offers. All Fingerprint recruiting email communications will always come from the @fingerprint.com domain. Any outreach claiming to be from Fingerprint via other sources should be ignored.
Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.
Due to regulatory and security reasons, there’s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based. Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location.
We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace.

Our work has been featured on websites like HubSpot, Shopify, Intercom, and CXL, and our strategies are used by many of the top content marketing teams around the world.
Our team is 100% remote. Learn about the core values that drive how we work and build a company.
About this role
Omniscient Digital is growing quickly, and we deeply believe in our commitment never to compromise content quality. It’s what differentiates us from other agencies. Writing great content requires great writers.
We’re taking on an increasing number of technical clients and are seeking a stellar writer with expertise in technical writing to create exceptional content for these clients. We’re seeking a writer with experience working with or writing on topics related to cloud security.
*Please note that we don’t work with writers who subcontract their work.
Responsibilities:
Create blog content (and potentially other types of marketing content) that appeals to:
Technical audiences such as cloud architects, providing value through in-depth insights, practical examples, and best practices
Semi-technical audiences like IT managers, VPs of Cloud and other decision-makers, focusing on strategy, business alignment, and high-level decision-making frameworks, while still acknowledging their subject matter expertise
Ensure projects are completed on time and meet quality standards
Implement comprehensive technical documentation, feedback, and changes whenever possible
Use company brand voice and messaging for written pieces to reinforce company culture
QA content for errors
Collaborate with fellow technical communicators to develop new approaches for creating more precise and engaging content for the company
Suggest best practices and optimizations throughout content generation projects
Manage complex information and multiple projects within content specifications and budget restrictions
Use previously selected fonts and other typographic elements
Job Qualifications and Technical Skill Sets:
2+ years of experience writing marketing content on the cloud. You can supplement your topic knowledge with thorough research to write content that aligns with our client’s expectations and speaks to their audience. You have the chops to deliver in-depth, practical info to advanced audiences like cloud engineers, but you’re just as capable of toning down technical details to communicate business value to decision-makers like CTOs and CFOs.
Familiarity with cloud security topics. You understand cloud computing fundamentals like cloud service models (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and deployment models (e.g., public, private, hybrid, multi-cloud). But your knowledge also extends to cloud security topics such as subtopics like the following:
DevSecOps
Cloud security posture management
Vulnerability management
Threat detection and response
Identity and access management
Data encryption
Compliance
Coding skills. You're no stranger to Javasrcipt, Python, and other coding languages and can include code snippets in your content.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills, and healthy analytical and critical thinking skills. You turn complex cloud-related concepts into compelling narratives. You’re skilled at finding the story within complicated topics and can capture our client’s brand voice in every piece of writing.
SEO experience. You’re not new to marketing and understand the various considerations that inform a piece of SEO content. You know how to search-optimize your content without sacrificing quality, and can balance the needs of both your client and reader.
Experience interviewing subject matter experts. You’re comfortable independently conducting SME interviews to add industry opinion and narrative to your content. You know how to draft questions to get the information you need and how to structure stories around the answers.
Time management and organizational skills. You always meet your deadlines—or communicate in advance when you may need a deadline pushed back.
Positive attitude. You’re kind, passionate, curious, and friendly! You’re open to exploring new ideas, keep updated on trending topics in the cloud technology space, and feel passionately about crafting excellent content. You welcome feedback and love learning how to improve your craft.
Experience with both print and digital media formats. You’re also proficient in word processor programs such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs and PDF software such as Adobe Acrobat.
Other Preferred Qualifications:
Hands-on experience with the cloud. Beyond writing, it’s a bonus if you have real-world experience as a security engineer, cloud architect, or site reliability engineer.
Portfolio
A recent portfolio with technical writing experience is a must. Please submit 3-5 sample articles that have been published within the past three years for consideration, at least 2 of which relate to the cloud. Older samples will be accepted only if accompanied by newer works.

Containerization & Virtualisation Engineer,Canonical,24 days ago,Remote,https://himalayas.app/companies/canonical/jobs/containerization-virtualisation-engineer,"Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.
The company is founder led, profitable and growing.
This is a general selection process for software engineers focused on virtualisation and container technology - from the kernel through userspace. Apply here if you are an exceptional Go, Rust, or C/C++ software engineer and want to work on next-generation open source VMM or container technology, or related open source networking and storage.
Container, virtualisation and cloud infrastructure have become essentials of modern software deployments. We invest in open source related to application isolation, workload orchestration, system or OCI containers, micro service architecture or cloud infrastructure.
Here are some examples of projects under way at Canonical.
RustVMM has great potential as a new hypervisor for Linux. We are building a team to work on this, with an emphasis on performance, security and operability. Work in Rust and bring your expert knowledge of VMM and related kernel networking and storage capabilities.
Docker images are easy to make and publish on Docker Hub and other registries, but the quality, consistency and security maintenance of those images is broadly very poor. Canonical is in a good position to publish a portfolio of outstanding Docker images. Our Rockcraft team is designing and implementing an elevated Docker image experience for the open source community.
LXD is a modern system container and virtual machine manager that is widely used on Ubuntu, ChromeOS and other Linux platforms. LXD engineering spans the entire software stack from low-level kernel work on namespaces, confinement, security, filesystems, VMMs and networking, to the high level management REST API and CLI.
Members of the Kubernetes product team build MicroK8s for on-rails K8s, and Charmed Kubernetes for more sophisticated integration. We work on K8s itself and on the operations tooling around it.
The OpenStack team deliver Charmed OpenStack, OVN / OVS and Ceph. This work brings cloud platform technologies to large-scale computing environments.
These teams hire system level C/C++, Golang, Rust and Python developers to work on security-critical, performance-critical and mission-critical code, focused on software delivery, containers, security, sandboxing, application orchestration and management. Our teams are motivated to have a meaningful impact on modern cloud computing technologies.

Ability to use scripting languages (preferably Ruby or Bash), and MVC frameworks (preferably Ruby on Rails)
Experience with Git and CI/CD
Expertise in writing support content
Ability to communicate complex technical topics to customers and coworkers of varying technical skill level
Familiarity with DevOps methodologies and technologies like Serverless and Kubernetes
Understand a range of different GitLab implementations, and how service interruptions impact the customer.
About the team
The Support team is distributed all over the world across AMER, EMEA, and APAC regions.

We are seeking a Senior IT Engineer to take ownership of our internal systems and infrastructure, drive automation, and lead the implementation of modern IT standards across the organization. This role is perfect for someone excited to scale secure, low-friction IT experiences in a fast-paced, remote-first environment.

Excellent communication and documentation skills.
Nice to Have

Golang Engineer,Aikido Security,1 month ago,Remote,https://himalayas.app/companies/aikido-security/jobs/golang-engineer,"🌍 We’re taking on the crusty global cyber market, the ""no-BS"" security platform for devs.
In the past, only large enterprises needed to worry about security. Today, cybersecurity has become the top concern of 75% of all CEOs, from startups to enterprises.
This means more work for developers, who need to become security experts and ensure their platforms are secure. But it’s hard. The market is riddled with overcomplicated, expensive tools that aren’t fit for developers. So, we founded Aikido.
We are the no-bullsh*t security platform that developers actually like to use. One central platform that shows devs what matters and how to fix it, so they can get back to building.
Why work with us? Founded in 2022 by third-time serial founders, with $25M funding in the bank, we're dead set on getting security done for devs. This is a chance to join an all-star team early, take ownership, and push boundaries.

Main responsibilities:
Write clean, efficient, and testable Go code
Managing AWS and lambda deployments
Design and implement high-availability applications
Discover, plan, write, document and maintain new features
Understand the fundamental design principles behind a scalable application
Understand the nature of asynchronous programming and its quirks and workarounds
Optimize the product code for speed where required
Requirements
We're looking for someone who is:
Really comfortable in a very entrepreneurial environment
Can think along with architectural and impactful decisions
Willing to learn new languages when the product requires it
Comfortable researching and tackling hard problems and algorithms
Willing to experiment (and also willing to perhaps throw away some code)
Medior to Senior:
We are going fast and need experienced people that can hit the ground running with us.
You need to be comfortable with the above mentioned languages and tech-stack.
No stranger to implementing automated testing platforms and unit tests
Fluent in English
What you can expect:
High-impact position in a fast-growing company
Competitive salary package
A company that sticks to their values in an open and informal atmosphere (see our culture-page on the website for more details)
A diverse and inclusive organization that is proud to be an equal opportunity employer
Flexibility in working hours and remote-first culture
You will be recruited based on competencies. Qualities of people are decisive, regardless of gender, religion, ethnic origin, age, sexual orientation or any disability."
Senior Support Engineer [IC3],Sourcegraph,1 month ago,Remote,https://himalayas.app/companies/sourcegraph/jobs/senior-support-engineer-ic3,"Who we are
Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that everyone can code, not just ~0.1% of the population.
We are transforming how the world’s most important companies build software by industrializing development with AI. Today, most professional developers spend a disproportionate amount of time understanding code and performing repetitive, low-level tasks—leaving less time for innovation and meaningful impact.
We’re changing that. Sourcegraph brings AI-powered search and agents to the enterprise, helping teams automate the mundane and amplify what developers do best— solving hard problems and creating great products.
Here’s how we’re making a difference:
Accelerating developers with AI agents that deliver insights and precision—enabling 5x faster test creation, 30% increase in merge requests, and saving 20 minutes per developer daily.
Automating repetitive tasks, from remediating vulnerabilities (saving teams 1,000+ hours annually) to speeding up migrations that would take years to months.
Enabling innovation by addressing complex problems like automated bug triage, vulnerability detection, and AI-driven code reviews seamlessly integrated into workflows.
Trusted by 7/10 top software companies by market cap, 4/6 top US banks and many of the companies leading global innovation, like Stripe, Indeed, Tesla, and 1Password, and with $225M in funding from investors like a16z, Sequoia, and Redpoint, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development.
If you’re passionate about solving the hardest problems in software and shaping the future of technology, join us. Let’s build something extraordinary together.
Hours & location
🌎 We hire almost anywhere in the world and we don’t have a location requirement for this role. However, the expected working hours for this position is 9:00am - 5:00pm EST.
That being said, we do not subscribe to “I do my best work when I work 40 hours a week.” People we hire at Sourcegraph believe that building outstanding things means working very hard — smarter and more hours than the competition.
Why this job is exciting
As part of the Technical Success organization, Support Engineering is at the forefront of the customer experience. Our customers simply wouldn’t be successful, happy, long term customers without the important work this team does! Support Engineering exists to not only resolve technical issues but educate our customers by answering reactive questions, and by importantly identifying improvements we can make to help improve the product. Our customers are developers and we help them throughout their customer journey.

We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognize outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals.
