Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.The company is founder led, profitable and growing.We have created a new career path at Canonical forPerformance Engineerswho bring exceptional clarity to software performance, correctness and efficiency. We are adding these roles to every engineering team at the company.As an open source platform, we have teams that work at every level of the software stack - from the kernel up through server and desktop applications, all the way to the web. We are adding roles with this focus in every engineering team in the company, to act asdrivers of performance engineering skills, tools, culture and insights to our entire product range. We have also created a central performance engineering team, where we will drive shared tools, dashboarding capabilities, measurement frameworks, analytical capabilities and skills. We call this career focus 'percorr' because we have found that the same deep insights that enable sophisticated performance measurement and design also enable teams to improve their harnesses and frameworks for correctness. Understanding not only the application, but the runtime, the compiler, and the system, all the way down to the CPU, gives an engineer the ability to think creatively and with insight about the right things to measure, and the right ways to verify correctness. We have found that performance engineers will often improve the deepest and trickiest areas of our test harnesses, and unblock their teams to test and measure previously 'dark' aspects of their work.We also have teams that work with every major silicon vendor and cloud, with a particular emphasis on performance optimisation of the entire stack for that architecture, CPU family or hypervisor. Our goal is to ensure that Ubuntu users can select whatever platform they want for their workloads and know they have access to the very best performance and efficiency across the entire stack from kernel to codec.If they wish, we will enable performance and correctness engineers to move between products every two years, so that they have the opportunity to raise the bar for performance in an array of products over time, and also that teams have the benefit of fresh eyes on their processes, thinking, harnesses, dashboards and code. Our performance and correctness leads are expected to betruly exceptional individuals, and also leaderswho are confident setting expectations of change, sharing insights and skills, running initiatives and programs.There is no way to move a meaningful codebase without also moving the people behind it.This is a career path for perfectionists and precision artists.

Enterprise Account Executive - Americas,Canonical,"Muscat, Oman",5 days ago,https://app.qureos.comhttps://app.qureos.com/jobs/enterprise-account-executive-americas-1749095275656,"Open source software is the new default in the enterprise, and Canonical is the new challenger to major enterprise software vendors.We deliver better open source from the data center to cloud and edge. Our Linux distribution Ubuntu is now the leading platform for public cloud compute, and the favorite platform for software engineers, data scientists and AI developers. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption and quality of open source globally, and our goal is to ship the most software on the planet by cores. A tidal wave of open source innovation is the next phase of the entire enterprise software industry, and we aim to be the most compelling way to ride that wave.Our customers include Global 500 enterprises and startups. We are expanding our product range from the base operating system - Ubuntu - to full enterprise solutions in infrastructure and applications. We can deliver software defined storage, private cloud solutions, container runtime environments, as well as databases, message queues, identity, observability, analytics, machine learning and web publishing capabilities. Customers love the idea that they can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application.Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are just over 1,000 colleagues in 70+ countries and $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.In building our sales team, we look for five things:Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problemsHigh intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidencePassion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizesTeamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitionsEnergy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customersUbuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their assigned territory.

Enterprise Account Executive,Canonical,"Muscat, Oman",5 days ago,https://app.qureos.comhttps://app.qureos.com/jobs/enterprise-account-executive-1749095275700,"Open source software is the new default in the enterprise, and Canonical is the new challenger to major enterprise software vendors.We deliver better open source from the data center to cloud and edge. Our Linux distribution Ubuntu is now the leading platform for public cloud compute, and the favorite platform for software engineers, data scientists and AI developers. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption and quality of open source globally, and our goal is to ship the most software on the planet by cores. A tidal wave of open source innovation is the next phase of the entire enterprise software industry, and we aim to be the most compelling way to ride that wave.Our customers include Global 500 enterprises and startups. We are expanding our product range from the base operating system - Ubuntu - to full enterprise solutions in infrastructure and applications. We can deliver software defined storage, private cloud solutions, container runtime environments, as well as databases, message queues, identity, observability, analytics, machine learning and web publishing capabilities. Customers love the idea that they can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application.Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are just over 1,000 colleagues in 70+ countries and $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.In building our sales team, we look for five things:Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problemsHigh intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidencePassion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizesTeamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitionsEnergy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customersUbuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their assigned territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagement, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness, to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy.

Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable, and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of 'most software to most companies'. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding developers themselves. They should be completely at home reviewing a patch or a software design spec. They are trusted engineers who understand the importance of a whole-team effort in creating great products and who enjoy seeing colleagues develop. They should contribute code themselves to set the standard for coding, but know that the code they write is far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team's direction, focus, and delivery. We grow management skills and train engineers who are interested in soft skills to be managers.A typical first-level software engineering team is based in a single time zone, such as EMEA or Americas, or APAC, with an Engineering Manager and a Senior Engineer dedicated to a single product, who work as a team to shape the roadmap, technical strategy, code, documentation, and community engagement. They are both capable of coding, and are both leaders comfortable assigning work and maintaining expectations of delivery.

We are looking for candidates who are technically skilled and familiar with embedded Linux and RTOS. We are expanding in all time zones, so we can accommodate candidates from almost any country as long as they have reasonable business access to a substantial market territory in person. As we grow our teams, we will also hire Sales Team Managers and Regional Sales Directors. Please continue with this process if your goal is a management leadership position.The server edition of Ubuntu is already very widely used in connected devices and industrial PCs. Our newer edition of Ubuntu for IoT, called Ubuntu Core, represents the state of the art in security and resilience for high-end appliances and equipment. Our customers include global brands in consumer and industrial electronics, as well as automotive and robotics. We continue to expand our range of offerings to bring our security, management, and developer experience to the smallest Linux environments and devices. We recently added a real-time Linux capability and are working towards a range of certifications for these offerings. Together, this portfolio is Linux reinvented for optimal reliability, security, developer productivity, and footprint.This is a prospecting sales and strategic account development role and requires energy, ambition, and focus. To be successful, you must be comfortable positioning and selling open source, services, and software solutions to all levels of an organization, and specifically to departments that are developing embedded software and IoT devices. You should also be familiar with at least one of our priority sectors.Customers love the idea that they can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across every cloud, every class of compute, and every category of application. Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting, and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote, and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position; it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision-making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long-term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world-leading company, we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment that promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration, and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.In building our sales team, we look for five things:Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problemsHigh intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidencePassion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizesTeamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitionsEnergy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customersUbuntu is already very widely adopted, which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with brands in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement, and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgment as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete, and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their assigned territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagement, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness, to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy.

Cloud Professional Services Manager,Canonical,"Muscat, Oman",5 days ago,https://app.qureos.comhttps://app.qureos.com/jobs/cloud-professional-services-manager-1749713421370,"This is an opportunity to run a Professional Services team (also known as Field Engineering) team, helping customers understand and implement Canonical's open source solutions in public clouds and in their own data centers. We work across the entire spectrum of cloud offerings, from Ubuntu itself to virtualisation and private cloud, Kubernetes, and the implementation of sophisticated open source solutions such as MLops platforms, data platforms and more. We are rapidly expanding the range of open source solutions we offer and deliver to customers, as we move into new industries like telco, finance, health care and media we design and develop new open source solutions to meet their needs.We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding engineers themselves. They should feel completely at home troubleshooting technical issues and having technical presales conversations with customers. They should contribute to project delivery themselves, but know that the technical contributions they bring are far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team's direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills and train engineers, who are interested in soft skills, to be managers.We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and enterprise compute. Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of 'most software to most companies'. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.The role of a Cloud Professional Services Manager at CanonicalThe Field Engineering team is our team of cloud solutions architects at Canonical, working directly with our customers, designing private and public cloud solutions fitting their workload needs. The portfolio of products includes on-premise cloud solutions such as Openstack, MicroCloud and Ceph, and solutions that could be deployed either on-premises or in public clouds such as Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Spark, PostgreSQL, etc. The team works hands-on with the technologies by deploying, testing and handing over the solution to our support or managed services team at the end of a project.

We are rapidly expanding the range of open source solutions we offer and deliver to customers, as we move into new industries like telco, finance, health care and media we design and develop new open source solutions to meet their needs.We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding engineers themselves.

Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of 'most software to most companies'.
