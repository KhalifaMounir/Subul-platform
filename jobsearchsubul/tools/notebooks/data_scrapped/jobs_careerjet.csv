Main tasks and responsibilitiesScope of Work:Olefin Cracker Feedstock selection: feedstock determines the yield and quality of the final products. The feedstocks used for olefin cracking are typically naphtha, LPG , Refinery Dry Gas , and natural gas liquids. Catalyst selection Commonly used catalysts include silica-alumina. Process conditions The temperature, pressure, and residence time of the feedstock in the cracking reactor are carefully controlled to optimize the yield and selectivity of the desired products: Ethylene & Propylene Monomer Production of Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether & Pyrolysis Gasoline Product recovery The products of the cracking process are typically separated using distillation, and then purified to meet the required specifications.NGLE: Pre-treatment Removing any impurities from the natural gas such as sulfur compounds, water, and other contaminants that can damage equipment or affect the quality of the natural gas liquids). Compression Natural gas is then compressed to increase its pressure and facilitate the separation of the natural gas liquids. Refrigeration The compressed natural gas Liquid is then cooled to low temperatures using refrigeration units. The cooling process causes the natural gas liquids to condense into a liquid state. Separation The natural gas liquids are then separated using a series of distillation towers. The NGLE distillation process separates the natural gas liquids from different fractions based on their boiling points. Fractionation The different fractions of natural gas liquids are then further processed through fractionation to separate them from gases and condensate liquid Product recovery The final step in the NGLE process is product recovery.
